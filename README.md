# Flight-Management-System

## INTRODUCTION 
This is our project about AIRLINE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM to manage flights and passengers efficiently in order to provide best service. 
We have implemented this project using the concepts of data structures and algorithm to make our program more efficient. 
We have provided few services such as adding flight, adding passengers and bookings.

## OBJECTIVES
Here's the logic behind our project. The user of the application will be the admin who will be serving the travelers. Our main objective is to manage and store all the data in the most efficient way which would help us to fetch and retrieve data easily. It is totally built at administrative end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed the access.
The purpose is to build this in a way that this reduces the manual and paper work for managing airline and passenger’s data. Moreover, we have also added to functionality to provide multiple path suggestions to the passengers from where they have pick what’s best for them. We can also see the flights detail, delete them and same goes for passengers. 
Moreover, we have worked with complex algorithms such as Floyd’s Algorithm and Djikstra Algorithm to find the best way to suggest passenger path according to user’s source and destination location. 

## Application have following features:
1. Adding routes with different number of cities.
2. Adding passengers.
3. Providing passengers best routes suggestions.
4. Booking flights.
5. Record of all flights data.
6. Record of passenger’s data.

## MOTIVATION
The motivation behind the idea is that now a days the world is getting digitalized so in order  to remove all manual and paper work we have created system which would help us to manage data more accurately and efficiently. Moreover, this will facilitate passengers to book flight more easily as we would be suggesting paths for the flights.

## FLOW OF APPLICATON
1. When the application runs, initially a primary menu is shown which contains 4 options Flights Panel, Passenger Panel, Booking Panel or Exit. Whatever admin choose that screen will be shown.
2. In flight panel, admin can add cities, flight routes, display cities or display flights. Since we are working with array list and linked list therefore program will proceed accordingly.
3. If admin choose passenger panel, he can add passenger, display individual passenger or all passengers together.
4. In booking panel, admin can find flights, best routes suggestion, book flights or cancel flight.
5. If any flights or passenger is added, it is linked by the nodes of linked list which makes it easier to manage data.
6. All exceptions are handled where admin is entering any information.
7. Firstly, cities are added in array list, then array list is passed to add connections in flight and then flights routes are created using the linked list.
8. Passenger are added on flights seats which they pick from the suggested flights.
9. This application also save files in order to keep data record.
10. It exits when admin closes the system.
 
 
## CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS WHILE DEVELOPING PROJECT 
Initially, while deciding the flow about how to program will process, we had hard time to find what functions must be included to make our program more efficient. After deciding the flow we headed toward the programming and starting implementing different logics in order to make our program more efficient. We first created a rough layout and flow to understand the working flow of application. We picked the best data structures and algorithm we can use according to our knowledge which is best fitted with our objectives. Then we moved toward the coding part to implement logics but started getting some bugs which needed to be fixed. We did some research and were able to find solutions. We debug out application to fix bugs and find best solutions. We added some validations and duplication checkers in order to handle all types of exceptions. The difficult part of the project was to suggest passengers the best routes. We researched about few algorithms like Floyd’s algorithm and Djikstra Algorithm. We then came up with the best solution of our own which fits perfectly with our project demand. We haven’t developed the excel exports or imports of datafiles instead we have used object file as they are in binary which make compiler to read more easily. 

## SCOPE OF PROJECT 
This application is very useful for a long run. This can help passengers to stop surfing around the different websites instead they directly gets the suggestion which best fits with their preferences. 
Moreover, data in managed efficiently and accurately which would help administrator to fetch everything easily.

## TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 
The language that is used is JAVA and for IDE IntelliJ IDEA is primarily used. Basic concepts of OOP along with best data structures and algorithm is used.
We have used array list and linked list with as our primary data structures. Object filing is used in order to store data for future.

## CONCLUSION 
Overall, the project has achieved its objectives. This helps to provide best services to both passenger and admin panel. We have tried to find ways to optimize and improve our project to test and learn more, and we have certainly been able to improve our Java skills mainly of data structures and different algorithms. If we see this project in a long run, the world is changing and now everything is digitalize so this will be a productive and to optimize work load of everyone and reduce human efforts and work load and replace manual paper work.
